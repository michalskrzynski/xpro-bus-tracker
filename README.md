# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Project description

This project is one of assignments from MIT xPro MERN Stack course. The goal was to create a simple bus tracking
website, that would visualize the position of buses from one line. The bus location is loaded from the public 
database MBTA. Refreshing is being done every 15 sec in order not to get banned by the administrator.

## How to run 

Just download the project and start **index.html** file. Then click "RUN" button to start tracking.

## Roadmap of future improvements

It would be nice to add the functionality to switch bus lines. Later it'd be great to suggest the shortest bus route to a desired destination.

## License

The project is under MIT license. See LICENCE file.
